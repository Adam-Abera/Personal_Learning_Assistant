# Personal_Learning_Assistant
## A learning assistant powered by generative AI
This project aims to use AI to create a learning assistant that takes into account the level of understanding a student has regarding the subject they are trying to learn. The assistant is a website that allows students to enter their educational level and the subject they wish to learn. Afterward, the students can chat directly with the AI or get recommended learning resources to use.

The interaction with the AI is done using Python while the website displays and handles interactions using PHP.
